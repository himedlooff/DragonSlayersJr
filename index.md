# The basics

We are a level 55+ clan. We are an active, nice, friendly clan.  Most members have been together for many, many months. We have a good mix of adults and teenagers. Our goal is to provide a fun environment where we can socialize while playing this fun game. We want active players who will chat, request and donate a lot. Currenly we are recruiting players at level 55+. The level of our members are constantly rising, and we will soon raise our level.

Donation Requirement: 

1. Keep your donated to received ratio within 1:3 (1 donation : 3 received)
2. Current minimum donation is 100 (subjected to change as our clan grow)

Elder Requirement:  (subjected to change as our clan grow)

1. Donate 500 to get promotion from member to elder
2. Donate 300 to remain elder
3. Must maintain 1:3 donate/received ratio to remain elder

# Leaders

- Leader:    Eagles
- Co-leader: Uncharted2000

# How to accept requests

1. The requesting player's level should be 55 or higher.
2. The requesting player's "Friend in Need" total should be their level times 100. For example if the player is level 72 then their "Friend in Need" status should be 7200 or higher.  This is more or less a guide line and not a strict number.
3. Exceptions will be made for player's level in the low 50's with very high "Friend in Need" status.

# Current Events

**NEW INFORMATION:** 

**Formation of DragonSlayers clan network:**

**Stage 1:** The formation of **DragonSlayers-I**

1. We will select 8-10 strong/active (not 8-10 best) elders from DragonSlayersJr to form the startup group of DragonSlayers-I
2. These elders must be the chatty bunch to give the new clan the vibrante/active atmosphere
3. These elders must give a strong and constant push to help recruit new players for **DragonSlayers-I**
4. At the same time we will lower the requirement for **DragonSlayersJr** to ease with the recruiting of new members to make up for the lost of the 10 strong elders
5. We will leave good and strong elders in **DragonSlayersJr** to make sure the clan continue to do well and grow.  REMEMBER that **DragonSlayersJr** is still our **main clan** at this early stage


**Stage 2:** Growing both **DragonSlayers-I** and **DragonSlayersJr**

1. Elders from both clans will recruit members and send new members to the appropriate clans
2. To help us grow fast, we will set both clans to "Anyone can join" but set the trophies a little higher.  
3. Once a new member join, we will point them to the website and ask them to move to the appropriate clan.  
4. If the new members are not willing to move to the "lower" clan, we will let them stay for a few days then the leader will "kick" them with the message of asking them to join the appropriate clan.
5. As DragonSlayersJr growing and reaching 45 members, we will slowly, one by one move qualify active elders to DragonSlayers-I
6. Qualified elders from **DragonSlayerJR** will be promoted to **DragonSlayersJr**

**Stage 3:** Reaching stability for both clans, **DragonSlayers-I** & **DragonSlayersJr**, and the creation of **DragonSlayers-II**

1. If things are going well for both clan, in 1-2 months we should reach 35 stable members in **DragonSlayers-I** and 45 members in **DragonSlayersJr**
2. If things go well, we should be able to move all qualified elders from **DragonSlayersJr** to **DragonSlayers-I**, at this point, **DragonSlayers-I** will become our **main clan**.
3. The rest of the active players from **DragonSlayersJr** will move to another new clan **DragonSlayers-II**

**Future Expansion of the DragonSlayers clan network**

**Stage 4:** The Creation of DragonSlayers-III


**PREVIOUS WEEK**

**Active King/Queen Contest**

**When:** From 12/23/2013 to 1/5/2014

**Who:** All can participate including leader and co-leader

**Why:** To see who are active and who can be the most active

**Rules:** 

1. The most active member who get the highest (DONATED + RECEIVED) in the two weeks period and the Donated:Received ratio is within 1:3 will be crowned Active King/Queen.  

2. The members with the worse ratio than 1:3 are automatically disqualified from the contest.  

3. In the event of a tie, which is highly unlikely, the tie breaker will go to the person who have the ratio closest to 1:1 and with a higher donation.

*(We are mindful that this contest is held during the Christmas break in most countries and those who normally active may not be able to participate fully.  Likewise, those normally not very active may be able to play more, thus the result of this contest may surprise us all.  The main thing is to* ***have fun*** *.)*
