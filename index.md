# The basics

We are a level 60+ clan. We are an active, nice, friendly clan.  Most members have been together for many, many months. We have a good mix of adults and teenagers. Our goal is to provide a fun environment where we can socialize while playing this fun game. We want active players who will chat, request and donate a lot. Currenly we are recruiting players at level 60+. The level of our members are constantly rising, and we will soon raise our level.

Donation Requirement: 

1. Keep your donated to received ratio within 1:3 (1 donation : 3 received)
2. Current minimum donation is 100 (subjected to change as our clan grow)

Elder Requirement:  (subjected to change as our clan grow)

1. Donate 400 to get promotion from member to elder
2. Donate 300 to remain elder
3. Must maintain 1:3 donate/received ratio to remain elder

# Leaders

- Leader:    Eagles
- Co-leader: Uncharted2000

# How to accept requests

1. The requesting player's level should be 60 or higher.
2. The requesting player's "Friend in Need" total should be their level times 100. For example if the player is level 72 then their "Friend in Need" status should be 7200 or higher.  This is more or less a guide line and not a strict number.
3. Exceptions will be made for player's level in the high 50's with very high "Friend in Need" status.

# Sister/Feeder Clan Information

**DragonSlayerJR** currently accept players of all levels.  Elders from the main clan will come and help with donation and recruit.

- Leader: L.A.S.E.R
- Co-leaders: (Selected elders from the main clain: Uncharted2000, Eagles, Himedlooff, AMMJRNguyen,...)

# Current Events

**Active King/Queen Contest**

**When:** From 12/23/2013 to 1/5/2014

**Who:** All can participate including leader and co-leader

**Why:** To see who are active and who can be the most active

**Rules:** 

1. The most active member who get the highest (DONATED + RECEIVED) in the two weeks period and the Donated:Received ratio is within 1:3 will be crowned Active King/Queen.  

2. The members with the worse ratio than 1:3 are automatically disqualified from the contest.  

3. In the event of a tie, which is highly unlikely, the tie breaker will go to the person who have the ratio closest to 1:1 and with a higher donation.

*(We are mindful that this contest is held during the Christmas break in most countries and those who normally active may not be able to participate fully.  Likewise, those normally not very active may be able to play more, thus the result of this contest may surprise us all.  The main thing is to* ***have fun*** *.)*
